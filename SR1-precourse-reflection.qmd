# I. Some questions about school and life:

*Where are you coming from (e.g. “I recently finished my undergraduate degree”, “I’ve been working in industry X for Y years”) (1-2 sentences)*

Prior to starting my Master's at UCSB, I completed my Bachelor's in Ecological & Environmental Sciences at The University of Edinburgh (Scotland, UK). On my 4th year of my Bachelor's, I applied and received a Fulbright Scholarship from the Spanish government, which allowed me to pursue my Master's here at UCSB. 

*What do you hope to get out of this class? (3-4 sentences)*

My 


*If you have a particular career goal in mind, how does this course apply to your future career, if at all? (1-3 sentences)*

After completing my Master's at UCSB, I envision myself working in the industry, whether that is the NGO sector, the consulting world, or the science communication field. I feel the need to explore life "outside" academia, as I haven't had a lot of time in

*What do you wish your instructors knew about you, but don’t? (2-4 sentences)*

I am an international student from Spain, and adjusting to the American educational system & expectations has been quite the challenge. 



#II. Some questions about the way you like to learn:

*What kinds of assignments, skills, or behaviors have you felt most comfortable with / enjoy from past classes? Why do you enjoy them? (4-5 sentences)*
I have found data group projects overwhelming, and that has mostly been due to "git conflicts" & never having been taught the theory of forking 

*How confident do you feel in your data visualization skills? Why? (3-4 sentences)*


*How confident do you feel in your coding skills (primarily R, but feel free to elaborate on any of the languages you’ve used)? Why? (3-4 sentences)*


*What have you struggled with in the past in other graduate-level courses? Why? (3-4 sentences)*


*Of the courses you’re taking this quarter, which do you expect to be the most challenging? Most demanding? (1-2 sentences)*


*What responsibilities do you have outside of school, and how do you want to balance them? (3-4 sentences)*


*Which learning goals from the syllabus are you most excited about? (3-4 sentences)*


*Most importantly, how do you plan on accomplishing your learning goals for this course? Note: be specific here! Instead of writing, “I will complete homework assignments” or “I will study”, you can make these more specific strategies: “I will create a schedule to map out assignments“ (elaborate on this), “I will use the homework assignments as opportunities to practice X,” I will communicate with classmates to ask for help after trying X,” “I will participate in online learning communities, such as TidyTuesday…” etc. (5-8 sentences)*


#III. Some fun questions:

*What activity(ies) (outside of school / work) brings you the most joy? How do you plan to incorporate that activity into your schedule this quarter (if at all)? If you are unable to do so, is there something else you can plan to do that will bring you similar joy? (3-5 sentences)*

Spending time in nature has been my cure in times of stress. I am a keen hiker, surfer, yogi and skater. I try to do yoga once a week, hike on the weekends, and surf whenever the forecast allows. If I have little chunks of time to spend indoors, I try to play some music (ukelele), write some poetry, or attempt to crochet (it is taking me longer than expected to get a hang of it).


*What is a piece of media you enjoyed recently? (e.g. music, book, movie, tweet, meme) (2-4 sentences)*

I recently listened to a podcast episode called "The Artist's Way", where Billy Chapata discusses how to channel the artist within you, build confidence in your skills/art, and the role of social media in the current art scene. Even though art is a hobby and not a profession to me, I thought this episode was very inspiring, and it made me think of an alternative future where I could have been a poet and not a researcher... Although I do not regret my choice!
